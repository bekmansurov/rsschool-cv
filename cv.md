### Briefly About Myself:

Having started my career as a junior Perl developer in a local company with minimum skills, I became profficient in Perl/PHP develop.<br>

Remote work gives me extra free time, which I spend learning Frontend Development.<br>
I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth,<br>
besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.<br>

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.<br>
